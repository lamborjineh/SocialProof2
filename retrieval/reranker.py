Cross-encoder reranking for evidence relevance — upgraded to L-12.

Problem with bi-encoder (BGE-M3 dense) alone:
  Even with hybrid scoring, the initial retrieval ranks by approximate
  semantic + lexical overlap. A cross-encoder is more accurate because
  it reads the claim and evidence TOGETHER (not independently encoded)
  and scores their specific logical relationship.

Solution — two-stage retrieval:
  Stage 1: BGE-M3 hybrid retrieval → top-30 candidates (fast, ~ms)
  Stage 2: Cross-encoder → re-score each (claim, sentence) pair (accurate, ~1-2s)
  Result:  Keep top-k by cross-encoder score

Model: cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2
  Upgraded from L-6 to L-12 (12 transformer layers vs 6).
  More accurate relevance scoring for the same MS MARCO passage retrieval task.
  Speed difference on CPU: ~0.5s per query (7 pairs) — acceptable for a web app.
  Size: ~133MB

Model priority (auto-detected):
  1. models/crossencoder_ph_finetuned  — fine-tuned on PH claim-evidence pairs
  2. cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2  — base L-12 model (default)

def rerank(claim: str, candidates: List[Dict], top_k: int = 10) -> List[Dict]:
    """
    Rerank a list of candidate evidence sentences using the cross-encoder.

    The cross-encoder reads (claim, evidence) as a single concatenated input
    and outputs a relevance score. This is slower than bi-encoder cosine
    similarity but significantly more accurate for passage relevance.

    top_k raised 7 → 10:
        rerank() now feeds MMR in retriever.search(), which selects the final
        diverse top-k from this pool. Returning 10 gives MMR more candidates to
        find genuinely different angles. If called directly without MMR, top_k=10
        is still fine — callers can slice downstream.

    rerank_score preserved on every dict:
        MMR uses rerank_score as its relevance signal. Do not remove this field.

    Args:
        claim:      The submitted claim text
        candidates: Evidence dicts from BGE-M3 retrieval (already threshold-filtered)
        top_k:      How many to return after reranking (default 10, feeds MMR)

    Returns:
        Top-k candidates sorted by cross-encoder rerank_score (descending).
        Each dict gains/updates: rerank_score (float).
        Falls back to original BGE-M3 ordering if cross-encoder unavailable.

    Pipeline position:
        retriever.search()
          → [pool of k*3 candidates]
          → rerank()       ← YOU ARE HERE (returns top 10)
          → _mmr()         (selects diverse final top-k from those 10)
          → final result

    Performance note (CPU, 10 pairs):
        L-12 model: ~550ms. MMR adds ~50ms. Acceptable for a web app.
