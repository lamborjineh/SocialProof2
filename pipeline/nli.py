SocialProof — Module 6: NLI (Contradiction Detection)  v4.1

v4.1 Changes:
  - Removed deep-translator / GoogleTranslator fallback path entirely.
    mDeBERTa-v3-base-mnli-xnli handles 100 languages including Filipino natively.
    Translation was only needed for roberta-large-mnli (English-only) which is no
    longer used. Dead code (_is_tagalog, _translate_with_timeout, _MULTILINGUAL_NLI,
    _TAGALOG_MARKERS) removed.

v4.0 Changes:
  - Model switched to MoritzLaurer/mDeBERTa-v3-base-mnli-xnli.
    Handles 100 languages including Filipino natively.
  - MIN_EVIDENCE_SIMILARITY restored to 0.30.
  - MIN_NLI_CONFIDENCE_FOR_DECISIVE lowered from 0.45 → 0.35.
  - classify_multi() added in v3.2: weighted multi-evidence NLI aggregation.
